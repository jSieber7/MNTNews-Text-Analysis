Over a thousand men a year now die as a result of  skin cancer  in the United Kingdom.  Of 1,777 people who died last year, 1,002 were men.  Experts say men are less likely to check their moles than women.  The incidence of skin cancer among UK males has risen by 42% during the last decade.    

More women than men are diagnosed with  melanoma  - skin cancer.  However, more men die because women are getting treatment earlier on during the  cancer's  development.    

The thicker a mole has become, the more likely it will be more difficult to treat successfully.  According to Cancer Research UK, men are going to their doctors when the melanoma is already quite thick.    


According to research carried out by Cancer Research UK, 60% of men never check their backs for new or changing moles.  Although one third of English men have experienced  sunburn , 70% think they are not at risk of skin cancer.    

If skin cancer is detected early, the patient's chances of survival are much better.    

Every twelve years the number of people getting skin cancer worldwide doubles.  Over-exposure to sunlight raises the risk of developing skin cancer.    

Some studies have also shown that regular exposure to some sunlight can actually protect from some cancers.  The risk for skin cancer is over-exposure.    Written by Christian Nordqvist
