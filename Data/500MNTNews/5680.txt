While it is wise to avoid burning [Kennedy et al., 2003] or excess tanning from solar or indoor ultraviolet radiation (UVR), it should be realized that solar UVB radiation (290-315 nm) is the primary source of  vitamin D  for most Americans and Europeans.  Dietary sources are inadequate and supplements have to be used carefully.    
Mid-day summer sun is the best source of UVB, since minimal exposure times are required, and the UVB to UVA (315-400 nm) ratio is highest.  If using sunscreen, it might be advisable to go into the sun for 10-15 minutes without sunscreen to generate a day's worth of  vitamin  D.  
   
As for  melanoma  and other  skin cancer , several points should be made.  First, while UVR generates free radicals that can do some of the damage, dietary  antioxidants  and skin pigmentation are nature's way of fighting free radicals.  A recent paper by Millen et al. [2004] reported that diets high in antioxidants and low in fats and alcohol can reduce the risk of melanoma by about 50%.  Smoking is also a risk factor for non-melanoma skin cancer.  Second, occupational exposure to UVR is associated with reduced risk of melanoma [Kennedy et al., 2003].     

The health benefits of UVB through production of vitamin D are considerable, with more benefits being recognized at a rapid pace.  My work indicates that over 20,000 Americans die prematurely annually from insufficient UVB/vitamin D [Grant, 2002].  I also estimate that half of those with  multiple sclerosis  in the U.S. would not have MS if they had as much UVB exposure as those living in the southern states.
