In 2003, the British people were told by the authorities that teenagers and children should not be given SSRI  antidepressants  after medical professionals were concerned that some of them became suicidal while others experienced serious mood swings.  Prozac continued to be recommended, for under 18s, but only in cases of severe  depression .    

So, why is it that in 2004-2005 over 84,000 children in the UK are still on such drugs?  Over 27,000 of those under 15.    

The 2004-2005 figures were made public after the Liberal Democrats asked for it in Parliament.    

According to Paul Burstow, LibDem Health Spokesperson, doctors are carrying on prescribing these drugs despite warnings by experts that they can lead to an increased risk of suicide.  He added that the â€˜shocking over-reliance on the use of these drugs demonstrates yet again the chronic shortage of talking therapies and the weakness of the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services. These figures should be ringing alarm bells at the Department of Health and calling into question the way in which advice on medicines is monitored.'    

The UK Dept of Health says some of these medications are used for other indications such as bed-wetting,  anxiety ,  obsessive compulsive disorder  and some  phobias .
   
Present guidelines in the UK are that the risks these drugs pose to children outweigh the benefits.    Written by Christian Nordqvist
