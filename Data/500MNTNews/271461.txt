In a study of 81 overweight and obese women with type 2 diabetes who usually consumed diet beverages and were on a weight loss program, those who substituted water for diet beverages after their lunch for 24 weeks had a greater decrease in weight (-6.40 vs. -5.25 kg) and body mass index (-2.49 vs. -2.06 kg/m2) compared with those who continued to consume diet beverages. 

Participants who switched to water also experienced greater improvements in fasting blood sugar levels and insulin sensitivity.

The findings are published in Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism.
