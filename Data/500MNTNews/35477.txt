The Scientific Committee on Consumer Products (SCCP) in an opinion report to the European Commission said that devices used to achieve and maintain cosmetic tanning, such as tanning lamps and sunbeds, may significantly increase a user's risk of malignant  melanoma  of the skin.    

It warns high risk people, such as those with freckles, atypical and/or multiple moles, those with a family history of melanoma, and people whose skin is highly susceptible to  sunburn , should never use these tanning devices for cosmetic purposes.    

As tanning devices are more dangerous for younger people, the EU commission also advises people under 18 not to use them.  In order to prevent misuse, the Commission calls on Member Governments and manufacturers of sunbeds and tanning lamps to make sure their devices have clear warnings and instructions.    

Standards authorities should introduce UV limits in products and introduce a guidance for the industry and consumers.  Solariums should apply these recommendations   

Commission Vice-President Gï¿½nter Verheugen, responsible for enterprise and industry policy, said "The Commission calls upon Member States and the sun-bed industry to ensure that appropriate warnings and instructions are provided with sun-beds in order to reduce the risks of users developing related  skin cancer . We call on Member States and industry to ensure an appropriate use of sun beds."    

Commissioner Markos Kyprianou, responsible for health and consumer protection policy, has declared "I am concerned that indiscriminate use of these tanning devices for cosmetic purposes could lead to an increased incidence of skin-  cancers . We need to act rapidly in order to raise public awareness of the risks associated with sunbeds. We also need guidance to consumers to help them recognise whether they have risk factors and should not use these devices. I will propose initiatives in that respect without delay".    
 What will the Commission do?   

The Commission will look at the report by the SCCP and see what measures could be taken, both legislative and non-legislative.  As a first priority, the Commission aims to inform consumers about the recommendations of the report through consumer organisations and Member State authorities.  A guidance fiche will be prepared by the Commission in all official EU languages - this will be done in cooperation with the European Dermatologists Association.    

The relevant standard - EN 60335-2-27:1997 - should be amended.  The standard should take into account the recommendations made, including those concerning irradiance.
