A new study finds that drinking carbonated soft drinks is not linked to esophageal  cancer  or cancer of the cardia, the place where the stomach and esophagus meet.
   
Jesper Lagergren, M.D., of Karolinska University Hospital in Stockholm, Sweden, and colleagues examined data from 189 patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma, 262 patients with cardia adenocarcinoma, and 820 controls. The patients were interviewed about their previous carbonated drink consumption.
   
The authors found that drinking carbonated soft drinks or low-alcohol beer was not associated with increased risk of esophageal or cardia adenocarcinoma. "This study gives no support for the hypothesis that the use of carbonated soft drinks contributes to the increasing incidence of this cancer," they write.
